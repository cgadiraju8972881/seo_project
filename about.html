            <h2>Our Mission: Simplifying Digital Interactions</h2>
            <p>The idea for the MuteMe button was born out of necessity. In a world where virtual meetings and online communication have become the norm, our founders recognized a common problem: the lack of a simple, reliable way to control microphone audio. Accidental unmuting and background noise were causing disruptions and privacy concerns. This inspired our team to create a solution that was both intuitive and effective.</p>
